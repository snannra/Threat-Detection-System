# Threat-Detection-System

The **Threat Detection System** is a Python-based security solution integrated with the Elastic Stack (ELK). It is designed to detect and alert users of malicious activities such as brute force attacks, port scanning, or privilege escalation by analyzing logs from multiple sources. The project leverages the MITRE ATT&CK framework to implement detection rules and provides a dashboard for real-time visualization of detected anomalies.

## Overview

This project serves as a robust solution for detecting and mitigating security threats by analyzing logs from various sources. By integrating Python with the Elastic Stack, we achieved a system capable of ingesting logs, identifying suspicious activities, and providing actionable insights through an interactive dashboard.

## Tools Used

1. **Python**:

- Core programming language used for processing logs, applying detection rules, and generating alerts.

2. **Elastic Stack (ELK)**:

- **Elasticsearch**: Used for indexing and searching log data. It acts as the central data store for logs and alerts.
- **Kibana**: Provides the visualization layer, where users can explore the "Threat Detection Dashboard" to view anomalies and metrics.

3. **MITRE ATT&CK Framework**:

- Served as the foundation for designing detection rules. This framework provides a comprehensive set of tactics and techniques that informed our approach to identifying malicious behavior in logs.

## Key Components

- **Log Ingestion**: Logs from multiple sources (e.g., servers, applications, and network devices) are collected and processed using Python scripts.
- **Detection Rules**: Detection logic is implemented using Python and mapped to MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques. Examples include:
  - Monitoring repeated failed login attempts to detect brute force attacks.
  - Analyzing port activity to identify port scanning attempts.
  - Detecting privilege escalation through unusual access patterns.
- **Visualization Dashboard**: A custom dashboard in Kibana presents key metrics, including detected anomalies, source IPs, affected systems, and more.
- **Alerts**: Real-time alerts are generated for detected threats, enabling swift incident response.

## How It Works:

1. Data Flow:

- Logs are ingested and preprocessed using Logstash.
- Processed logs are indexed into Elasticsearch for efficient searching and querying.
- Python scripts analyze logs and apply detection rules, flagging suspicious activities.

2. Visualization:

- Kibana serves as the visualization layer, presenting insights on detected threats and overall system health.

3. Threat Detection:

- Rules defined in Python scripts check for patterns and anomalies.
- Alerts are stored in Elasticsearch and can be viewed or exported as needed.

4. Integration:

- The system integrates seamlessly with existing logging infrastructure, supporting scalability and customization based on user needs.

## Reflection on Tool Usage

The combination of Python and the Elastic Stack proved effective for building a scalable, real-time threat detection system. While Python handled the data processing and rule implementation, Elastic Stack excelled in log management and visualization, ensuring the project achieved its goals efficiently. The use of the MITRE ATT&CK framework provided a structured and industry-standard approach to defining detection criteria, enhancing the system's reliability.

## Future Enhancements

- **Advanced Analytics**: Incorporating machine learning models to detect novel threats and improve anomaly detection.
- **Scalability**: Expanding support for additional log formats and sources.
- **User Management**: Adding role-based access control to enhance system security.
- **Automated Reporting**: Generating periodic reports with detailed analyses of detected threats and system performance.
